# PiPe
A plugin for spigot-based servers that allows you to make Python plugins!
Just ensure that you've installed the `jep` package on PyPi (and have added the folder to your library path),
have a working CPython installation, and it should work! (NOTE: Currently this plugin does not support reloading, and doing so WILL crash it.)
